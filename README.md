## chi2residuals R-package

The chi2residuals package provides tools to explore and visualize chi-square residuals between two qualitative variables. It helps identify significant associations and deviations from expected frequencies using intuitive plots.

### package installation
```r
library(devtools)
install_github("cdesterke/chi2residuals")
```

### load library and perform preprocess with variable selection
```r
library(chi2residuals)
data(patients)
str(patients)
head(patients,n=10)
sub <- preProcess(patients, v1 = "AgeGroup", v2 = "PrimarySymptom")
head(sub,n=10)
```

### compute chi2 residuals for the 2 selected qualitative variables

```r
residuals <- computeResiduals(sub, col1 = "AgeGroup", col2 = "PrimarySymptom")
```
![res](https://github.com/cdesterke/chi2residuals/blob/main/residuals.png)

### draw heatmap of the results with significant residuals
```r
plotResiduals(residuals,
              col1 = "AgeGroup",
              col2 = "PrimarySymptom",
              themeSize = 20,
              labelSize = 5,
              colorLow = "turquoise",
              colorHigh = "purple",
              colorLabels = "white",
              title = "Significant residuals p<0.05")
```

### draw network of the results with significant residuals
```r
plotNet(residuals,
        var1 = "AgeGroup",
        var2 = "PrimarySymptom",
        node_colors = c(AgeGroup = "green", PrimarySymptom = "skyblue"),
        edge_colors = c(positive = "red", negative = "blue", nonsignificant = "lightgrey"))
```
